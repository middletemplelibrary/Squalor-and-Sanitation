## Introduction: From Squalor to Sanitation

This exhibition explores the impact of epidemics on public health law. From plagues to the present, the display will look at the way public officials manage the spread of disease, as they try to understand the causes of illness.\
\
Uniquely placed near the epicentre of many of these historic pandemics, the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple observed the streets and sewers change around it- change implemented to improve public health and take London from squalor to sanitation.\

## Great Plague 1665-1666

“The Pestilence being a contagious distemper, it is one of the first principles that every family should abstain, as much as possible, from conversing with others. When a house is infected with the plague, we shut it up.”\
-Scott, Narratives of two families exposed to the Great Plague of London, pg 6\
\
The Great Plague of 1665-1666 began in the overcrowded parish of St. Giles in the Field. By the end of the epidemic, 68,596 deaths were officially recorded in London; although, the capital’s true figure is likely closer to 100,000. At the time, many believed in the miasma theory- disease spread from smelling the “bad air” released from waste and decomposing material, while others believed it was a punishment from God.\
\
Those who were able to leave the city did, including King Charles II and his Court. The poor remained behind in cramped, unsanitary conditions, which exacerbated the spread.\
\
The government introduced some measures to prevent the plague from spreading, including “shutting up” (quarantining) plague victims in their homes for 40 days, marking their home with a red cross and having it guarded by a watchman. Public gatherings were also banned during this time and fires were lit in the street ‘to correct the air’ affirming the belief breathing smoke was better than miasma.

## Samuel Pepys; selected and edited by Robert Latham, The Illustrated Pepys, 1979
     
Samuel Pepys (1633-1703) worked in the Navy and was a Member of Parliament. He was 26 years old in 1660, when he started keeping detailed observations in his now famous diary.  His account of many historical events, including King Charles II’s coronation, the Great Plague and Great Fire of London, serves as an important primary source of London during a tulmultous decade.\
\
“Today, I saw two or three houses marked with a red cross upon the doors, and “Lord have mercy upon us” written on them; which was a sad sight to me, as it was the first time I had seen this. It made me nervous.”\
-Pepys’ Diary; 7th June 1665\

##John Scott, Narratives of two families exposed to the Great Plague of London, A.D. 1665, 1832

John Scott was the vicar of North Ferriby and minister of St. Mary’s, Hull in the early 19th century.  The vicar purchased a 1722 publication titled: Due Preparations for the Plague, as Well for Soul as Body from a London book stall around the late 18th century.\
\
Divided into two parts, the book begins with an anonymous account of a family of seven quarantined in the parish of St. Albans, on Wood Street in London during the time of the Great Plague in 1665. The second narrative of Due Preparations for the Plague follows a series of conversations amongst another family as they focus on spiritual preparation and ‘the necessity of living prepared for death and eternity’ during the plague.\
\
Deeply moved by the stories, Scott published this abridged version of the book, under the title, Narratives of two families exposed of the Great Plague of London, writing “to young persons, in particular, I dare promise that it will afford much interesting information; while I hope it may at the same time, by the blessing God, make very salutary impressions on their heart.”
